# Download raw weather data

## Get the weather data and write it to a file
# Appending a date stamp to the file name ensures it's a unique name.
# This builds a history of the weather forecasts which you can revisit at any time to recover from errors or expand the scope of your reports
# Using the prescribed date format ensures that when you sort the files, they will be sorted chronologically. It also enables searching for the report for any given date.
