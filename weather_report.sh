## OJECTIVES OF SCRIPT
# 1. Download raw weather data
# 2. Extract data of interest from the raw data
# 3. Transform the data as required
# 4. Load the data into a log file using a tabular format
# 5. Schedule the entire process to run automatically at a set time daily

## Set the PATH explicitly
# To avoid issues when running as a cron job
export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

## Set the variable to prepare to download via curl and get the date to add to the file name
city=casablanca

## Get the weather data and write it to a file
# Appending a date stamp to the file name ensures it's a unique name.
# This builds a history of the weather forecasts which you can revisit at any time to recover from errors or expand the scope of your reports
# Using the prescribed date format ensures that when you sort the files, they will be sorted chronologically. It also enables searching for the report for any given date.

# Go get the weather data

# If curl fails (exit status other than 0), the script can either retry the download or exit early.

## Extract the required data from the raw data
# Grabs the temperature data from the weather report and stores it in a file
